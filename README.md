## Project Overview
> This project aimed to set up an application that allowed Students to register for their prospective courses in a timeley and orderly fashion. The application can be used to speed up the task of registering for courses without consulting an advisor. The application addresses mistakes that the user can make by checking for null inputs, repeated inputs, or inputs that would cause the amount of course hours in a semester to exceed 9.

## Development Highlights
> During the development of this project I feel that I enjoyed and understood the process of creating methods and variables for their use later or elsewhere in the code. Sometimes I found round about ways to solve problems, but I feel that this stemmed from my creativity in problem solving.

## Console vs. WPF Application Design
### Console Application Design
> The console application provided a quick and easy method for interfacing with a computer to select courses to enroll in. The user was presented with a list of courses and their corresponding number and was asked to enter the number that corresponded with the course they wanted to enroll in. Once a user chose a course they were shown what they were registered in said course. Input validation was built in to ensure duplicate registration was not allowed and that 9 credit hours were not exceeded during its run time. 

### WPF Application Design
> The WPF application took the coding capability of the previous command line interface version and turned them into a useable GUI. The GUI contained a drop down menu with the available courses. Text boxes were present that tracked the number of credit hours the courses would equal up to as well as the names of the courses. There was also the same input validation that stopped the user from enrolling in duplicate courses. The validation also stopped the user from enrolling in more than 9 course hours in a semseter.

## Debugging and Coding Strategies
> My main debugging strategy was to check in the main area of the code, or the main method in which objects and other methods were called upon. From there I could see if things being called upon were causing errors or if their were missing functions that could be in different areas of the code.

## Innovative Solutions and Challenges
> I regularly had to refer back to resources such as documentation or stackoverflow. Sometimes I even refered to reddit. Understanding the basics allows you to implement your knowledge in an effort to accomplish a coding task. Combining that with the ability to learn on the fly is amazaing especially in the tech industry in which we expirence ever evolving products and solutions.
